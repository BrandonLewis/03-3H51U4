## Key Findings

### 1. IFC File Unit Analysis

From `/home/user/03-3H51U4/DATA/4.013_PR_RW Points_S-BD_RW1.ifc`:

**Declared Units:**
- Base unit: `METRE` (IFCSIUNIT)
- US Survey foot defined: 0.3048006096 m/ft
- ifcopenshell unit scale: **1.0** (1 model unit = 1 meter)

**Site Origin:**
```
Easting:  2,081,474.47 m
Northing:   666,740.95 m
Elevation:      687.31 m
```

**Example Start Points:**
```
RW Sta 0+035.11: E=2,081,471.89 m, N=666,616.08 m
RW Sta 0+000.97: E=2,081,463.77 m, N=666,582.58 m
```

### 2. Alignment XML Coordinate System

From `/home/user/03-3H51U4/DATA/03-3H51U4-A.xml`:

**Declared Coordinate System:**
- **EPSG:2871** - HARN/CA California State Planes, Zone II, **US Survey Feet**
- Linear unit: `USSurveyFoot`

**Sample Alignment Coordinates:**
```
First point:
  Northing: 2,183,846.40 ft
  Easting:  6,827,025.60 ft
```

## Critical Coordinate System Mismatch

### Three Different Coordinate Systems Detected:

| Source | Coordinate System | E Range | N Range | Units |
|--------|------------------|---------|---------|-------|
| **IFC Files** | EPSG:2767 (assumed) | 2,081,xxx | 666,xxx | Meters |
| **XML Alignment** | EPSG:2871 (declared) | 6,827,xxx | 2,183,xxx | US Survey Feet |
| **Control Points CSV** | EPSG:2871 (assumed) | 6,829,xxx | 2,187,xxx | US Survey Feet |

**Observation:** XML and Control Points match, but IFC coordinates are in a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT system!

## Scale Factor Test Results

### Test: Finding the factor to get 83 ft distance

Using user-provided coordinates:
- RW Sta 0+035.11: E=2,081,471.89, N=666,616.08
- Site Origin: E=2,081,539.56, N=667,013.23

**Current calculation:**
```
Offset: ΔE = -67.67 m, ΔN = -397.15 m
Distance: 402.87 m = 1,321.76 ft
```

**ERROR: This gives 1,321.76 ft, not 39.34 ft OR 83 ft!**

**Exact scale factor needed to get 83 ft:** 0.0628x (about 1/16th)

**Conclusion:** The "Site Origin" coordinates provided appear to be **INCORRECT** for calculating distance to CM 10.99.

---

## Hypotheses Tested

### ❌ Hypothesis 1: Double the coordinate offsets
- **Result:** 2,643.53 ft (way too large)
- **Verdict:** REJECTED

### ❌ Hypothesis 2: IFC coordinates are in feet but treated as meters
- **Test:** If IFC values are actually in EPSG:2871 feet
- **Result:** Direct distance would be 6.8 million feet
- **Verdict:** REJECTED - coordinate magnitudes don't support this

### ⚠️ Hypothesis 3: Wrong reference point (CM 10.99)
- **Finding:** CM 10.99 coordinates from Control Points CSV are in EPSG:2871
- **Issue:** Cannot directly compare with IFC coordinates in EPSG:2767
- **Verdict:** **LIKELY ROOT CAUSE**

### ⚠️ Hypothesis 4: Distance is measured along alignment, not straight-line
- **Consideration:** If CM 10.99 to RW Sta 0+035.11 is measured along a curved path
- **Impact:** Could explain difference between coordinate distance vs station distance
- **Status:** **NEEDS VERIFICATION**

## Unit Conversion Analysis

### US Survey Foot vs International Foot
```
US Survey inch:     0.025400050800102 m
US Survey foot:     0.304800609601219 m
International foot: 0.304800000000000 m
Ratio:              1.000002 (negligible difference)
```

**Conclusion:** US Survey vs International foot difference is **NOT** the cause (only 0.0002% difference).

### Double Conversion Test
If coordinates in US Survey feet are wrongly treated as meters:
```
100 ft → wrongly interpreted as 100 m → 328.08 ft
Error factor: 3.28x
```

**Observed error:** 2.11x
**Conclusion:** Not a simple unit misinterpretation

## Coordinate Transformation Requirements

### To properly compare IFC and Control Points:

**Option A: Transform IFC to EPSG:2871**
```python
from pyproj import Transformer
trans = Transformer.from_crs('EPSG:2767', 'EPSG:2871', always_xy=True)
rw_e_ft, rw_n_ft = trans.transform(2081471.89, 666616.08)
```

**Option B: Transform Control Points to EPSG:2767**
```python
trans = Transformer.from_crs('EPSG:2871', 'EPSG:2767', always_xy=True)
cm_e_m, cm_n_m = trans.transform(6829001.34, 2187051.01)
```

**Critical:** Cannot compare raw coordinates from different coordinate systems!

---

## IFC Header Investigation

### What the IFC Header Shows:

✅ **Confirmed:**
- Base unit declared as METRE
- No scale factors in unit definitions
- No IFCCONVERSIONBASEDUNIT with multipliers for length
- Only angle conversion (degrees to radians)

### What This Means:

The IFC file is **correctly declaring** its units as meters. The question is whether the actual coordinate VALUES are truly in meters or if there's an export error.

---

## Critical Questions That Need Answers

1. **How was the 83 ft measurement taken?**
   - Is it straight-line Euclidean distance?
   - Or distance measured along the alignment?
   - Or offset distance from centerline?

2. **Which CM 10.99 coordinates are correct?**
   - Control Points CSV: E=6,829,001.34 ft, N=2,187,051.01 ft (EPSG:2871)
   - Need to know: What are CM 10.99 coordinates in EPSG:2767?

3. **What is the actual source coordinate system of IFC?**
   - Is it EPSG:2767 (meters) as assumed?
   - Or could it be EPSG:2871 (feet) with wrong header?
   - Check Civil 3D export settings!

4. **Are we comparing the right points?**
   - Is RW Sta 0+035.11 the correct point?
   - Is CM 10.99 the correct reference?
   - Could there be a different CM point or RW station?

## Recommended Actions

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

1. **Transform CM 10.99 to EPSG:2767**
   ```python
   from pyproj import Transformer
   trans = Transformer.from_crs('EPSG:2871', 'EPSG:2767', always_xy=True)

   # CM 10.99 from Control Points CSV
   cm_e_ft = 6829001.34
   cm_n_ft = 2187051.01

   # Transform to meters
   cm_e_m, cm_n_m = trans.transform(cm_e_ft, cm_n_ft)

   print(f"CM 10.99 in EPSG:2767: E={cm_e_m:.2f} m, N={cm_n_m:.2f} m")
   ```

2. **Calculate distance using matching coordinate systems**
   ```python
   import math

   # RW Sta 0+035.11 from IFC (in EPSG:2767)
   rw_e = 2081471.89
   rw_n = 666616.08

   # Calculate distance
   dist_m = math.sqrt((cm_e_m - rw_e)**2 + (cm_n_m - rw_n)**2)
   dist_ft = dist_m * 3.28084

   print(f"Distance: {dist_ft:.2f} ft")
   ```

3. **Verify Civil 3D export settings**
   - Check what coordinate system was used during IFC export
   - Verify if coordinate transformation was applied
   - Look for any scale factors in export dialog

4. **Cross-check with alignment XML**
   - Find station 0+035.11 on the alignment
   - Get its EPSG:2871 coordinates from XML
   - Transform to EPSG:2767 and compare with IFC

### INVESTIGATION TASKS:

1. **Check all three IFC files**
   - Do RW1, RW2, RW3 use the same coordinate system?
   - Are the units declared consistently?

2. **Create coordinate comparison table**
   - List all RW stations from IFC
   - List all CM points from CSV
   - Calculate all pairwise distances
   - Find which pair gives ~83 ft (or ~39 ft)

3. **Examine IFC export source**
   - Check if there are Civil 3D drawing files
   - Review export log if available
   - Verify coordinate system settings in source model

## Conclusion

The 2x scale issue **CANNOT be explained** by:
- Site origin offsets
- Unit conversion errors (US Survey vs International feet)
- Double application of scale factors
- ifcopenshell interpretation errors

The root cause is **COORDINATE SYSTEM MISMATCH**:
- IFC files appear to use EPSG:2767 (meters)
- Control Points and XML use EPSG:2871 (US Survey feet)
- Direct comparison of raw coordinates is INVALID

**Next Step:** Transform coordinates to matching system and recalculate distances using the corrected transformation script provided above.

**Critical Data Needed:**
1. Confirmation of IFC source coordinate system (check Civil 3D export)
2. Verification of how "83 ft" was measured
3. Transformed CM 10.99 coordinates in EPSG:2767
